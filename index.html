			<p>Flowers in hand, waiting for me
			Every word in poetry
			Won't call me by name, only "Baby"
			The more that you give the less that I need
			Everyone says I look happy
			When it feels right
			</p>
			<p>know that you're wrong for me
			Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
			I brought you down to your knees
			'Cause they say that misery loves company
			It's not your fault I ruin everything
			And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
			Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
			I'm everything they said I would be
			La-la-la
			I'm everything they said I would be
			</p>	
			<p>I'll put you down slow, love you, goodbye
			Before you let go, just one more time
			Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
			A little more hurt won't kill you
			Tonight mother says "You don't look happy"
			Close your eyes
			</p>
			<p>I know that you're wrong for me
			Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
			I brought you down to your knees
			'Cause they say that misery loves company
			It's not your fault I ruin everything
			And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
			Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me
			I'm everything they said I would be
			</p>	
			<p>Oh, ah, ah
			</p>
			<p>know that you're wrong for me
			Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
			I brought you down to your knees
			'Cause they say that misery loves company
			It's not your fault I ruin everything
			And it's not your fault I can't be what you need
			Baby, angels like you can't fly down here with me, oh-oh
			Angels like you can't fly down hell with me
